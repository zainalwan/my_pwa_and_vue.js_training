# My PWA and Vue.js Training

## Introduction
This is my web app (source code) as my exercise of PWA and Vue.js. The web app
has a feature to display the user's name. The web app was made using Vue.js and
Bootstrap. Some codes were taken from developers.google.com to set up a part of
the PWA.

## License
Vue.js, Bootstrap, and Google's codes use their own license. However, you might
use, study, modify, and share my code.
